              With 1 year of experience in software development, I am proficient
              in C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework, Object-Oriented Programming
              (OOP), and SQL Server. I have also worked with Java, HTML5, CSS,
              and JavaScript and have some experience with Linux kernel

              Before pursuing software development, I was a financial manager
              with an MBA (Master of Business Administration) and 11 years of
              experience in the finance industry. I am now seeking opportunities
              that allow me to combine my expertise in both programming and
              finance to create impactful solutions.
